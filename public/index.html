      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
      I'm very sorry, but apparently this is what the web has become.
      I wish I could fix it, but for the time being it seems we're stuck
      with running arbitrary scripts on every single website there is.
      <br /><br />
      I wish I could say one day things will be better, but I don't know
      that's the case. But at least we can take comfort in the knowledge
      that perhaps WebAssembly will one day replace this wretched thing
      that is JavaScript.
