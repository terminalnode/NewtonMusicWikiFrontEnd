        Newton Music Wiki (NMW) is a database, editable by anyone, for music data.
      </p>
      <p>
        With NMW you no longer have to wonder what albums you're favourite artists
        have released, what songs they've made and so on. All that information is
        just a click away!
      </p>
      <p>
        And because all information is editable by our users, and because this page
        is so great that everyone will want to use it, you can be sure that everything
        you see is always up to date!
      </p>
      <p>
        We value your privacy, and because of that all edits are <em>anonymous</em>.
        No one, not even we, will ever know who put the data in, we're just happy to
        know that it's there and that it's accurate.
